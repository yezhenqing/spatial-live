Spatial-live: A Lightweight & Versatile Visualization Tool for Spatial-Omics Data
=================================================================================

**Spatial-live** is a lightweight and versatile visualization tool specifically developed for single 
cell spatial-omics data analysis, including spatial transcriptiomics and more. Its 3D integration
of multiple layers within a single space makes it highly suitable for visualizing multi-modal
spatial data. Leveraging the rendering capabilities of WebGL2 (GPU) technology, Spatial-live efficiently
processes large datasets, offering interactivity, responsiveness, and a wide range of visualization
effects through the stacking of multiple layers. As the saying goes, a picture is worth  a thousand 
words. We firmly believe that effective data visualization plays a pivotal role in data exploration 
and interpretation, serving as a key component in gaining insights from complex datasets. Spatial-live
represents a valuable tool for achieving these objectives.

The development of Spatial-live relied on several outstanding third-party libraries, such as deckgl,
vue3, and react framework, alongside numerous other open-source libraries that may not all be listed
here. I am immensely grateful for the contributions of these libraries and the invaluable work they 
have provided.
